# Super Bowl Stats page

I wanted to show more of my capabilities than just one stats table
Should be able to run with other json files with minimal changes (game id is hard coded at the moment),

The major goals were to show portability and modularity.
I also being that the data was json, I used async.js instead of underscore to show how
I would handle functions with database calls, which aren't needed with json.

I wanted to make angular directives that could be used on any page by themselves.

tools used
-node.js
-underscore
-async.js (to show how I would handle async calls);
-gulp
  -browserify
-sass
